# Compinator
This is a program used to host and process online competitions.
This is not guaranteed to work and very WIP.

## The creator
Digipr01 AKA DNFcubing

## Why I made it
I host the weekly competition in the DannyHTv Discord server and it takes too long to do manually, so lets do it this way :D

## How it works
Enter your api key and a spreadsheet ID (must be public) in a .env file that looks kind of like the one in the Example File folder. Then hit run and your computer will do the rest :D
